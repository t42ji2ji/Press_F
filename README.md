# üïØÔ∏è Press F (to pay respects)

**Press F** is a decentralized protocol for turning viral tweets into on-chain tokens ‚Äî a new way to capture, trade, and reward internet attention, and finally gives credit where it's due.

With one keystroke (you guessed it, press F), users can instantly deploy a token tied to any tweet. The original author can later prove authorship using ZK verification and claim a share of the token‚Äôs fees ‚Äî ensuring creators benefit if and when their content goes viral.

## üß© What's in the system?

- **Chrome Extension**:  
    Hover over any tweet. Press `F`. Automatically reply with `@payrespectsbot` which triggers token creation.

- **Tag Bot** (`@payrespectsbot`):  
    Listens for tags. When triggered, it:
    1. Deploys a unique token tied to the tweet
    2. Replies with the token contract address

- **Token Registry**:  
    Each coin is canonically linked to one tweet. This creates a "tradable attention asset" for that post.

- **ZK Poster Verification**:  
    The original poster can cryptographically prove authorship via ZK and claim a cut of transaction fees. There is no centralized gatekeeping.

## üí° Why "Pay Respects"?

In today's memecoin world, iral content drives value in crypto ‚Äî but creators rarely benefit.

Press F flips the dynamic:

- Memecoins emerge organically from viral moments
- Anyone can mint a coin for a tweet
- If it pops off, the creator shares in the upside

This isn‚Äôt just meme culture. It‚Äôs attribution economics, powered by trustless tech.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. User hovers over a tweet and presses `F` (via extension)
2. The extension replies with `@payrespectsbot`
3. The bot:
    - Deploys a memecoin tied to that tweet
    - Replies with `"token live; ca: [address]"`
4. The original poster can:
    - Visit the redemption platform
    - Prove ownership using ZK verification
    - Claim a share of the transaction fees
