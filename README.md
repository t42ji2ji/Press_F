# üïØÔ∏è Press F (to pay respects)

**Press F** is a decentralized meme protocol that turns viral tweets into tradable tokens ‚Äî and finally gives credit where it's due.

At its core, Press F is a system that lets anyone instantly deploy a memecoin tied to a specific tweet. The original tweet author can later prove authorship and **claim a share of the token's transaction fees** ‚Äî a fairer, more respectful memecoin model.

## üß© What's in the system?

- **Chrome Extension**:  
    Lets users interact with tweets directly. Hover over any post on Twitter, press `F`, and automatically reply with `@payrespectsbot`.

- **Tag Bot** (`@payrespectsbot`):  
    Listens for these tags. When triggered, it:

    1. Deploys a new memecoin tied to the tweet
    2. Replies with the token's contract address

- **Token Creation & Registry**:  
    Each token is uniquely tied to a tweet. This creates a canonical "official coin" for that post.

- **ZK Poster Verification**:  
    The original tweet author can use **zero-knowledge proof** to demonstrate they control the account that posted the tweet ‚Äî and claim a portion of the token's transaction fees.  
No centralized verification is required ‚Äî just on-chain proof of authorship.

## üí° Why "Pay Respects"?

In today's memecoin world, viral content often gets used and monetized by others, with the original creators left out.

Press F flips the dynamic:

- Anyone can spin up a coin with one keypress
- The memecoin may still spread organically
- **The poster gets rewarded** if it pops off

It's a remix of meme culture, cryptoeconomics, and attribution ‚Äî powered by trustless tech.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. User hovers over a tweet and presses `F` (via extension)
2. The extension replies with `@payrespectsbot`
3. The bot:
    - Deploys a memecoin tied to that tweet
    - Replies with `"contract deployed, ca: [address]"`
4. The original poster can:
    - Visit the redemption platform
    - Prove ownership using ZK verification
    - Claim a share of the transaction fees
